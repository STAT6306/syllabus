# syllabus
The course syllabus will be updated periodically throughout the semester.
In particular, we will set office hours and exam dates.

Office hours: Friday from 1 - 2 pm 

Note: I will be out of town September 21 and hence class will be cancelled 
that day.  We will see about rescheduling the class for the following day.
EDIT: We will be having an exam on Sept 21.
