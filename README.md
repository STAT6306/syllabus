# General Philosophy
Defining data science is a hotly contested enterprise, and I will not
endeavor to do so here.  My perspective on this class is one of focusing "on
the horizon"; by that I mean the dominant task will be to learn
underlying principles of methodology instead of the nitty gritty details of
currently used software. This perspective has generated various levels of
consternation in students and hence deserves comment.
The rapid obsolescence
of specific computational tools suggests
that today, the academic community can best focus on teaching
broad principlesâ€”"science" rather than "engineering" (Donoho 2017).  An
example of this phenomenon would be the shift from Hadoop to Spark.


It is my
opinion that this will provide more lasting benefit to a student.  However,
it comes at the cost of denying a student an opportunity to answer in
the affirmative to an interview question of the sort "do you have
substantial experience with
<insert computational/hardware tool here, e.g. Spark or H2O>".
 This type of experience will need to be gained in another context.
